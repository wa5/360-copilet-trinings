# GitHub Copilot Training

## Overview
This repository contains a structured training guide for learning to use GitHub Copilot effectively. It covers setup, workflows, exercises, best practices, and evaluation criteria to help developers integrate Copilot into their daily coding tasks.

## Objectives
- Understand what GitHub Copilot is and how it works.
- Configure Copilot for local development environments.
- Learn strategies for prompt engineering and code completion.
- Practice with hands-on exercises and real-world examples.
- Evaluate and improve code generated by Copilot.

## Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with Git, VS Code, and the command line.
- A GitHub account with Copilot access (trial or subscription).
- VS Code installed with the GitHub Copilot extension.

## Setup
1. Install the GitHub Copilot extension in VS Code.
2. Sign in to GitHub and authorize Copilot.
3. Configure settings: enable inline suggestions, adjust telemetry and privacy settings as needed.
4. Set preferred languages and file types for suggestions.

## Recommended Workflow
- Start with small, well-scoped prompts.
- Accept suggestions as drafts; review and refactor generated code.
- Use explicit prompts for function signatures, types, and examples.
- Combine Copilot suggestions with test-driven development (TDD).

## Prompting Tips
- Provide context: include comments, function names, and expected behavior.
- Use examples: show desired input/output pairs.
- Ask for variations: "Give three alternative implementations."
- Specify constraints: performance, memory, libraries, or style guides.

## Hands-on Exercises
1. Autocomplete: Create a function with a clear docstring and let Copilot complete it.
2. Refactor: Ask Copilot to refactor a legacy function into smaller parts.
3. Tests-first: Write unit tests, then prompt Copilot to implement the code to satisfy tests.
4. Edge cases: Request implementations that handle nulls, invalid inputs, and errors.
5. API integration: Have Copilot scaffold requests to a public API and process results.

## Review & Quality Assurance
- Always run and debug generated code.
- Add or update unit tests for generated functions.
- Inspect for security issues, injection risks, and data leaks.
- Verify licensing and third-party dependency usage.

## Best Practices
- Treat Copilot as a coding assistant, not an authoritative source.
- Keep prompts explicit and minimal to reduce ambiguity.
- Maintain code style using linters and formatters.
- Document decisions and override suggestions when necessary.

## Troubleshooting
- If suggestions are irrelevant, clear local context or restart VS Code.
- Update the Copilot extension to the latest version for improvements.
- Check GitHub account permissions if sign-in fails.

## Evaluation & Metrics
- Measure productivity: time to implement features before/after.
- Track suggestion acceptance and modification rates.
- Monitor defect rates and code review feedback for generated code.
